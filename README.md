- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gabriel!
- ðŸ‘¨ I'm polish guy, who work in warehouse in The Nederlands. But it's not what I want to do forever. I'm learning programming to earning money by doing something, what I like 
- ðŸ’» I'm learning C# and .Net technology. I like creating a program logic, for some company industry for exemple. This is why I choose this, not some frontend web-mastering, or game developming. 
- ðŸ“š Now I'n learning how to create Web API by using .Net, and Entity Framework. 
- ðŸ’µ After I feel ready, I'm gonna looking for job as junior develoer, but..

-  :blush: Have a nice day!
